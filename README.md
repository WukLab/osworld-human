Computer-use agents (CUAs) are often unusable due to extreme end-to-end latencyâ€”taking tens of minutes for tasks humans complete in just a few. We present the first temporal performance study of computer-use agents on OSWorld and find that large model calls for planning and reflection dominate latency, with later steps taking up to 3Ã— longer than earlier ones. To measure efficiency, we introduce OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of OSWorld with human reference trajectories. Evaluating 16 agents, we find even top performers take 1.4â€“2.7Ã— more steps than necessary.
