Computer-use agents (CUAs) are often unusable due to extreme end-to-end latency‚Äîtaking tens of minutes for tasks humans complete in just a few. We present the first temporal performance study of computer-use agents on OSWorld and find that large model calls for planning and reflection dominate latency, with later steps taking up to 3√ó longer than earlier ones. To measure efficiency, we introduce OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of OSWorld with human reference trajectories. Evaluating 16 agents, we find even top performers take 1.4‚Äì2.7√ó more steps than necessary.

## Usage
To compute your agent's score on OSWorld-Human, simply provide the path to the `result` directory generated by OSWorld and the maximum number of steps your agent could use.
```bash
python score.py --result-path /path/to/results/ --max-steps-scoring 50
```

If you would like to score the UI-TARS trajectories that have been submitted to OSWorld, add the `--uitars` flag to the command.
